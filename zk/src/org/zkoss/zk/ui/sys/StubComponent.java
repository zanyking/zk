/**
 * A stub component is a 'degenerated' component that does not maintain
 * the states at the server. Rather, the states are maintained at the
 * peer widget (running at the client).
 *
 * <p>Application isn't really aware the existence of a stub component.
 * Rather, it is used by ZK Loader to minimize the footprint, if
 * it found a component doesn't have to maintain the states at the server
 * after renderred.
 * For example, {@link org.zkoss.zk.ui.HtmlNativeComponent} and stub-only components
 * will degenerate to {@link StubComponent} or {@link StubsComponent} after renderred.
 * Refer {@link Component#setStubonly} for details about a stub-only component.
 *
 * <p>A component that wants to degenerate to a stub component usually
 * invoke {@link #replace} after {@link #redraw} is called.

	 * only derived classes of {@link AbstractComponent}.
	 * @param bFellow whether to add this component to the map of fellows
	 * if it is assigned with an ID. If false, the component (comp) cannot
	 * be retrieved back even with an ID.
	 * @param bListener whether to retain the event listeners and handlers.
	 * If true, the event listeners and handlers, if any, will be registered
	 * to this stub component. In other words, the event will be processed.
	 * However, it is a stub component, rather than the original one.
	 * I means the event is the most generic format: an instance of
	 * {@link org.zkoss.zk.ui.event.Event} (rather than MouseEvent or others).

	 * If false, this component won't have any children, and all UUID of children
	 * reference back to this component.<br/>
